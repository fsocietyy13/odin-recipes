        <ul>
            <li>½ pound fettuccine, uncooked

            </li>
            <li>cooking spray

            </li>
            <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips

            </li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups fat-free, reduced-sodium chicken broth

            </li>
            <li>4 teaspoons flour

            </li>
            <li>4 ounces PHILADELPHIA Neufchatel cheese, cubed

            </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons KRAFT Grated Parmesan Cheese, divided

            </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder

            </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon pepper

            </li>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat large nonstick skillet sprayed with cooking spray on medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is done, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the skillet.

            <li>Mix broth and flour into the same skillet. Stir in Neufchâtel cheese, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, garlic powder, and pepper; cook, whisking constantly, until mixture boils and thickens, about 2 minutes. Stir in chicken.
            </li>
            <li>Place cooked fettuccine in a large serving bowl. Add chicken mixture; toss to coat. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan.
            </li>

        </ol>
